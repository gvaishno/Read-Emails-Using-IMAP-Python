Read Emails Using IMAP (Python)

<b>Prerequisite</b><br>
For Google Mail<br>
1. Go to https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha and click "continue". This is going to allow access from other servers.<br>
2. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/u/1/lesssecureapps and turn on access. Some apps and devices use less secure sign-in technology, which makes your account more vulnerable. You can turn off access for these apps, which we recommend, or turn on access if you want to use them despite the risks.<br>
3. Go to https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop and enable IMAP access. This is going to enable access Gmail from other clients using IMAP.
